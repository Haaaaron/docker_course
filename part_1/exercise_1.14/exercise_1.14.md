I modified the docker files in folders

    ../exercise_1.12
    ../exercise_1.13

Then rebuilt the images:

    ../exercise_1.13/docker build . -t example-backend
    ../exercise_1.13/docker build . -t example-frontend
    
Then launched in separate terminals 
    
    docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080  example-backend
    docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3456:3456 example-frontend 

Then each respective terminals gave the responses
