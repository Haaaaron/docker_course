# docker_course
Docker course for HY MOOC

# Structure

Parts for the docker course are split into folders

```
/part_1
/part_2
/part_3
```

within the folders each exercise has a markdown file `exercise_X.Y.md` where `X` is the part number and `Y` the exercise number. If the specific exercise required other files such as a Dockerfile then the solutions lie in a folder `/Exercise_X.Z`. For example:

```
/part_1
    /exercise_1.Y
        Dockerfile
        exercise_1.Y.md
    exercise_1.Z.md
```
